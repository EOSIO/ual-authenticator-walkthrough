## Overview

The Universal Authenticator Library creates a single universal API which allows app developers to integrate ***multiple*** signature providers with just a few lines of code. This is done through custom `Authenticators`.

An `Authenticator` represents the bridge between [UAL](https://github.com/EOSIO/universal-authenticator-library) and a custom signing method.

A developer that wishes to add support for their signature provider to UAL must create an `Authenticator` by implementing 2 classes. An `Authenticator` and a `User`.

The `Authenticator` class represents the business logic behind the renderer, handles login/logout functionality and initializes the `User` class.

Logging in returns 1 or more User objects. A `User` object provides the ability for an app developer to request the app `User` sign a transaction using whichever authenticator they selected when logging in.

In this tutorial I'll walk through the steps of implementing a custom `UAL Authenticator`, we'll be creating a [ual-ledger](https://github.com/EOSIO/ual-ledger) Authenticator. I'll try to explain some of the implementation specific details for `ual-ledger` and show examples of other UAL Authenticators.

Each step in this tutorial has a correlating branch on github labeled `step-1`, `step-2`, etc. Each step assumes you are starting at the correlating branch.

At the end we'll test the custom Authenticator with an example app found in [example/app](./example/app).

## Getting Started

## **Step 1**: Project setup


```bash
~ git clone git@github.com:EOSIO/ual-authenticator-walkthrough.git
~ cd ual-authenticator-walkthrough/examples/authenticator
~ yarn
```

At this point you should have a basic folder structure that looks like this.

## **Step 2**: Creating the abstract `Authenticator` and `User` classes

Create a new class `Ledger` in `src/Ledger.js` thats extends from the `Authenticator` class and add empty functions for all the abstract methods.

Next we'll do the same thing for the `LedgerUser` in `src/LedgerUser.js` that extends from the `User` class.

 Export both files from `src/index.js` with the contents below.

```javascript
export * from './Ledger'
export * from './LedgerUser'
```

## **Step 3**: Implementing the `Authenticator` class

The internal business logic of each Authenticator method will depend on the signing method you are using. The only limitations are the input/return types must match the abstract method it is implementing.

Although not all methods may be necessary for your `Authenticator`, you're required to implement ***all*** abstract methods from the base [Authenticator](https://github.com/EOSIO/universal-authenticator-library/blob/develop/src/Authenticator.ts) class.

The key methods here are `init, getStyle, login, logout`.

1. **`init()`** - Should be used to handle any async operations required to initialize the authenticator. `isLoading()` should return true until all async operations in `init` are complete and the authenticator is ready to accept login/logout requests.
2. **`getStyle()`** - Gives you the ability to customize your `Authenticator` and how it is displayed to app users.
    ```javascript
    getStyle() {
      return {
        // An icon displayed to app users when selecting their authentication method
        icon: './custom-icon.png',
        // Name displayed to app users
        text: 'Ledger',
        // Background color displayed to app users who select your authenticator
        background: '#44bdbd',
        // Color of text used on top the `backgound` property above
        textColor: '#FFFFFF',
      }
    }
   ```
3. **`login()`** - The implementation depends entirely on the signing method you are using, whether it supports multiple chains, and the communication protocol used. You'll need to create a new `User` class, verify the keys match the account provided, add the `User` to an array, and return the array of `User`'s. Otherwise throw an error with the appropriate messaging, this error will be displayed to the app user.

    **Here are variations of `login()` with a brief description of the different approaches.**

   * [ual-ledger](https://github.com/EOSIO/ual-ledger/blob/develop/src/Ledger.ts#L48) - Ledger requires an `accountName` and calls `requiresGetKeyConfirmation` to determine if the app user has already confirmed the public key from their ledger device, if so they won't need to give permission again. By calling `LedgerUser.isAccountValid()` the authenticator utilizes the  [eosjs-ledger-signature-provider](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosjs-ledger-signature-provider) and communicates with the ledger device through the `U2F` protocol.
      ```javascript
      async login(accountName) {
        for (const chain of this.chains) {
          const user = new LedgerUser(chain, accountName, this.requiresGetKeyConfirmation(accountName))
          await user.init()
          const isValid = await user.isAccountValid()
          if (!isValid) {
            const message = `Error logging into account "${accountName}"`
            const type = UALErrorType.Login
            const cause = null
            throw new UALLedgerError(message, type, cause)
          }
          this.users.push(user)
        }

        return this.users
      }
      ```

    * [ual-scatter](https://github.com/EOSIO/ual-scatter/blob/develop/src/Scatter.ts#L91) - Scatter does not require an `accountName` parameter and uses the [Scatter-JS](https://github.com/GetScatter/scatter-js) library to communicate with [Scatter Desktop](https://get-scatter.com/).
        ```javascript
        async login() {
          try {
            for (const chain of this.chains) {
              const user = new ScatterUser(chain, this.scatter)
              await user.getKeys()
              this.users.push(user)
            }

            return this.users
          } catch (e) {
            throw new UALScatterError(
              'Unable to login',
              UALErrorType.Login,
              e)
          }
        }
        ```
    * [ual-lynx](https://github.com/EOSIO/ual-lynx/blob/develop/src/Lynx.ts#L102) - Lynx injects a `lynxMobile` object into the browsers global window object, by accessing `lynxMobile` we can call `requestSetAccount` and receive an object containing the account information of the account logged into the Lynx Wallet.

      ```javascript
      async login() {
        if (this.users.length === 0) {
          try {
            const account = await window.lynxMobile.requestSetAccount()
            this.users.push(new LynxUser(this.chains[0], account))
          } catch (e) {
            throw new UALLynxError(
              'Unable to get the current account during login',
              UALErrorType.Login,
              e)
          }
        }

        return this.users
      }
      ```

4. **`logout()`** - Responsible for terminating connections to external signing methods, if any exist, and deleting user information that may have been cached in the `User` or `Authenticator` classes.

    **Variations of `logout()`**

    * [ual-ledger](https://github.com/EOSIO/ual-ledger/blob/develop/src/Ledger.ts#L65) - The [eosjs-ledger-signature-provider](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosjs-ledger-signature-provider) performs a simple caching of public keys that need to be cleared on logout. We accomplish this by calling `signatureProvider.clearCachedKeys()` and remove the logged in users by reassigning `this.users` to an empty array.

      ```javascript
      async logout() {
        try {
          for (const user of this.users) {
            user.signatureProvider.cleanUp()
            user.signatureProvider.clearCachedKeys()
          }
          this.users = []
        } catch (e) {
          const message = CONSTANTS.logoutMessage
          const type = UALErrorType.Logout
          const cause = e
          throw new UALLedgerError(message, type, cause)
        }
      }
      ```

    * [ual-scatter](https://github.com/EOSIO/ual-scatter/blob/develop/src/Scatter.ts#L108) - Calling `this.scatter.logout()` removes the `Identity` from scatter utilizing scatters built in method for logging out.
      ```javascript
      async logout() {
        try {
          this.scatter.logout()
        } catch (error) {
          throw new UALScatterError('Error occurred during logout',
            UALErrorType.Logout,
            error)
        }
      }
      ```
    * [ual-lynx](https://github.com/EOSIO/ual-scatter/blob/develop/src/Scatter.ts#L108) - Since lynx does not provide a method of logging out we simple reassign `this.users` to an empty array.

        ```javascript
        async logout() {
          this.users = []
        }
        ```

## **Step 4**: Implementing the `User` class

You are required to implement all abstract methods from the base [User](https://github.com/EOSIO/universal-authenticator-library/blob/develop/src/User.ts) class.

The main methods to be implemented here are `getKeys, signTransaction, signArbitrary`.

  1.  **`getKeys()`**  - Calling this method should return an array of public keys üîë. How the authenticator gets those keys depends on the signing method you are using and what protocol it uses. For example, `ual-ledger` uses the [eosjs-ledger-signature-provider](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosjs-ledger-signature-provider) to communicate with the Ledger device through the U2F protocol and `ual-scatter` simply returns the keys it has already received from the inital call to `scatter.getIdentity`.

      **Here are variations of `getKeys()`**
      * `ual-ledger`
        ```javascript
        async getKeys() {
          try {
            const keys = await this.signatureProvider.getAvailableKeys(this.requestPermission)
            return keys
          } catch (error) {
            const message = `Unable to getKeys for account ${this.accountName}.
              Please make sure your ledger device is connected and unlocked`
            const type = UALErrorType.DataRequest
            const cause = error
            throw new UALLedgerError(message, type, cause)
          }
        }
        ```
      * `ual-scatter`
        ```javascript
        async getKeys() {
          if (!this.keys || this.keys.length === 0) {
            // `refreshIdentity` calls `scatter.getIdentity` then
            // sets the `keys` and `accountName` properties on the
            // `User` class
            await this.refreshIdentity()
          }

          return this.keys
        }
        ```

  2. **`signTransaction(transaction, config)`** - Exposes the same API as `Api.transact` in [eosjs](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosjs/blob/develop/src/eosjs-api.ts).

  3. **`signArbitrary(publicKey, data, helpText)`** - A utility function to sign arbitrary data. If your authenticator does not support this type of signing you can simple return an error with the correct message.

      **Example of an authenticator that does not support `signArbitrary`**
      ```javascript
      // LedgerUser.js

      async signArbitrary() {
        throw new UALLedgerError(
          `${Name} does not currently support signArbitrary`,
          UALErrorType.Unsupported,
          null,
        )
      }
      ```
